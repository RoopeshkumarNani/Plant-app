# Clear Supabase Storage

## Steps to Delete All Images from Supabase Storage:

1. Go to Supabase Dashboard → Storage
2. Click on the `images` bucket
3. Select all files (or use the "Select All" option)
4. Click "Delete" button
5. Confirm deletion

## Alternative: Using SQL (if you have RLS policies set)

You can also delete via SQL, but Storage is usually easier via the dashboard.
